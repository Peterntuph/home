    excerpt: "As a statistician or so-called data scientist, it is not only important to master the methods of data analysis, but also know how to pass the analysis results clearly to others and ensure our research reproducibility.

Here I am going to provide a quick tour of R Markdown and construct your own R markdown file within 10 minutes."
