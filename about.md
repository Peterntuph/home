Hi! I'm a 1st Bioinformatics Ph.D. Student at the University of California, San Diego. 

I'm a Quantitative Researcher in biomedical science passionate about leveraging the power of statistics to improve population health. With 4+ years of hands-on research experience collaborating with experts in Biotech, National labs, Universities, and Hospitals, my career goal is to turn data into actionable insights to transform Cancer Care & revolutionize Public Health.

Previously at UCLA, I worked on mediation analysis for a three-arm randomized controlled trial & a PGS-based risk stratification model in a survival analysis setting at UCLA. Previously, I worked as a Biostatistician Intern in Foundation Medicine, Inc. where I verified the Assay Performance for FoundationOneÂ® Liquid CDx (F1LCDx) and designed a new study criteria for Diagnostic Assay Precision.
