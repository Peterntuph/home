title: "Basic Technics in Markdown"
---
## This is my first post. 
### I am going to practice and introduce some basic technics in Markdown. So, Let's get started!!
### Italics and Bold
* To make the pharse _italics_ in Markdown, you need to surround words with an underscore (`_`).

  For example: 

  `_The New England Journal of Medicine_`

  Result:

  _The New England Journal of Medicine_

* To make the pharse **bold** in Markdown, one must surround words with two asterisks(`**`).
  
  For example: 

  `**The New England Journal of Medicine**`

  Result:

  **The New England Journal of Medicine**

### Header
* To make headers in Markdown, you have to preface the phrase with a hash mark (#).
The smaller size of the header you want, the fewer numbers of hash marks you place. 

For example:

  `#This is header 1`

  `##This is header 2`

  `###This is header 3`

  `####This is header 4`

  `#####This is header 5`

  `######This is header 6`

Result:

  # This is header 1
  ## This is header 2
  ### This is header 3
  #### This is header 4
  ##### This is header 5
  ###### This is header 6

### Links and Images
* To make links to other web sites on the world wide web, you wrap the link text in brackets ([]), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis (( )).

  For example: 

  `[Direct to google](www.google.com)`

  Result:

  [Direct to google](www.google.com)
  
* The syntax is nearly the same in  creating images. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).

  For example: 

  `![Lebron James](https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/lebron-james-3.jpg)`

  Result:

  ![Lebron James](https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/lebron-james-3.jpg)
