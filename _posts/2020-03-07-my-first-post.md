## This is my first post. I am going to practice and introduce some basic technics in Markdown. So, Let's get start!!
### Italics and Bold
1. To make the pharse _italics_ in Markdown, you need to surround words with an underscore (_).
For example: 
`_The New England Journal of Medicine_`
Result:
_The New England Journal of Medicine_

2. To make the pharse **bold** in Markdown, one must surround words with two asterisks(**)
